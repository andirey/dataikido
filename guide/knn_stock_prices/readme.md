The **kNN** algorithm is a **non-parametric algorithm** that can be used for either **classification or regression**. Non-parametric means that it makes **no assumption** about the underlying data or its distribution.

For each data point, the algorithm finds the k closest observations, and then classifies the data point to the majority.
